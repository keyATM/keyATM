# Options
`keyATM` takes various options. You can set options through a list.
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
my_options <- list(
  seed          = NULL, # automatically generate random seed
  iterations    = 1500,
  verbose       = FALSE,
  llk_per       = 10,
  use_weights   = TRUE,
  weights_type  = "information-theory",
  prune         = TRUE,
  thinning      = 5,
  store_theta   = FALSE,
  store_pi      = FALSE,
  parallel_init = FALSE,
  resume        = NULL
)

out <- keyATM(
  docs      = keyATM_docs,    # text input
  regular_k = 3,              # number of regular topics
  keywords  = bills_keywords, # keywords
  model     = "basic",        # select the model
  options   = my_options,     # use your own option list
  keep      = c("Z")          # keep a specific object in the output
)
```

### `seed`
This is a seed used to generate random numbers. The same seed is used for initialization and fitting the model (`set.seed()` is executed before both initialization and fitting). If you do not provide `seed`, **keyATM** randomly selects a seed for you.


### `iterations`
The  default value is `1500`.


### `verbose`
Default is `FALSE`. If it is `TRUE`, it shows values of log-likelihood and perplexity.


### `llk_per`
**keyATM** calculates and stores the log-likelihood and perplexity. The default value is `10`.


### `use_weights`
The default value is `TRUE` (use weights). We follow the weighting Scheme in Wilson \& Chew (2010). If you do not want to use weights, please set it to `FALSE`. Please check our paper for details.


### `weights_type`
You can select one of four weights implemented in **keyATM**. The default is `information-theory`. **keyATM** can construct weights from the inverse frequency of the words, `inv-frequency`. There are normalized version of two: `information-theory-normalized` and `inv-freq-normalized`.


### `prune`
Prune keywords that do not appear in the documents.


### `thinning`
The default value is `5` and **keyATM** keeps every $5$th draw from the sampling.

### `store_theta`
The default value is `FALSE`. Storing the value of thetas allows the calculation of credible intervals.


### `store_pi`
The default value is `FALSE`. Storing the value of $\pi_k$ for all $k$ (the probability that the topic $k$ use keyword topic-word distribution).


### `parallel_init`
Parallelize processes to speed up initialization. Default is `FALSE`. Note that even if you use the same `seed`, the initialization will become different between with and without parallelization.


### `resume`
The resume argument is used to save and load the intermediate results of the keyATM fitting process, allowing you to resume the fitting from a previous state. The default value is `NULL` (do not resume).


# Priors
You can manually set priors, but we **do not** recommend doing it unless you understandd the consequences.


### `alpha`
Prior for the document-topic distribution. This option only works for `base` model.


### `beta`
Prior for the topic-word distribution.


### `beta_s`
Prior for the keyword topic-word distribution.


### `gamma`
Prior for the probability of using keywords in a topic.

### `eta_1`, `eta_2`, `eta_1_regular`, and `eta_2_regular`
Hyperprior for the `alpha` (used in the base and the dynamic models).


# Keep
You can specify which output to keep (cf. Calculating [heterogeneity](keyATM_cov.html#covariates-and-topic-word-distribution)).
