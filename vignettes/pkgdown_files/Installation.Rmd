You can install **keyATM** from either CRAN or GitHub. CRAN has a stable version while GitHub stores the latest version and developing version.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN (updating keyATM is the same command)
install.packages("keyATM")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("keyATM/keyATM", ref = "v0.5.0") # specify a branch
```

If you want to try the latest development version, please specify the name of the branch with `ref` argument in `devtools::install_github`. You can find branches in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/keyATM/keyATM/branches).
